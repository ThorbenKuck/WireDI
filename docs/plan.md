# WireDI Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the WireDI project based on an analysis of the current codebase, existing documentation, and future requirements. WireDI is a dependency injection framework that combines compile-time processing with runtime flexibility, offering the performance benefits of compile-time analysis while maintaining the adaptability of runtime configuration.

The plan is organized into key areas of improvement, each with specific goals, rationale, and proposed changes. The implementation of this plan will enhance WireDI's performance, usability, maintainability, and feature set, positioning it as a leading dependency injection framework for Java applications.

## Core Architecture Improvements

### Goal: Enhance the Foundational Architecture

**Rationale:** The current architecture, while functional, has areas that could benefit from refactoring to improve maintainability, performance, and extensibility. The WireRepository class has grown in complexity and would benefit from being split into more focused components.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **Refactor WireRepository Class**
   - Split into smaller, more focused classes following the Single Responsibility Principle
   - Extract factory methods into a separate factory class
   - Implement the Builder pattern for configuration to improve readability and maintainability
   - Create clear interfaces between components to reduce coupling

2. **Optimize Performance**
   - Profile the application to identify bottlenecks in the initialization and runtime phases
   - Implement lazy loading where appropriate to reduce startup time
   - Optimize memory usage by reducing redundant data structures
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed components

3. **Enhance Error Handling**
   - Create a consistent error handling strategy across the framework
   - Improve error messages with more context to aid debugging
   - Implement a centralized error logging and reporting mechanism
   - Add support for custom error handlers to allow applications to handle errors in application-specific ways

   - Document the conditional loading system for users

2. **Improve PropertyBinding**
   - Add support for nested classes in PropertyBinding
   - Implement automatic resolution of the correct property path
   - Add validation for property bindings to catch configuration errors early
   - Create comprehensive documentation with examples

3. **Implement Scopes for WireRepository**
   - Add support for different bean scopes (singleton, prototype, request, etc.)
   - Design an extensible scope system that allows custom scopes
   - Ensure proper lifecycle management for scoped beans
   - Document scope usage with examples

4. **Make the Aspect System Pluggable**
   - Extract aspect functionality into a plugin architecture
   - Support custom aspect implementations
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing aspect usage
   - Create documentation for aspect development

5. **Add Injection Support for PropertyReference Parameters**
   - Implement property reference injection
   - Add validation for property references
   - Ensure type safety for property references
   - Document property reference usage with examples

6. **Implement "Strict" Mode**
   - Design a mode that maximizes compile-time processing
   - Reduce runtime customization options for improved performance
   - Implement compile-time validation to catch errors early
   - Document the benefits and limitations of strict mode

## Integration Improvements

2. **Improve Security Integration**
   - Add support for role-based access control
   - Implement security annotations for method-level security
   - Integrate with standard security frameworks
   - Document security integration usage with examples

3. **Enhance Cache Integration**
   - Support different cache providers (in-memory, distributed, etc.)
   - Add cache statistics and monitoring
   - Implement cache eviction policies
   - Document cache integration usage with examples

4. **Improve Messaging Integration**
   - Support different messaging protocols (JMS, AMQP, etc.)
   - Add message validation and transformation
   - Implement retry and error handling for messaging
   - Document messaging integration usage with examples

5. **Enhance Metrics Integration**
   - Add support for different metrics providers
   - Implement automatic metrics collection for key components
   - Add dashboard integration for metrics visualization
   - Document metrics integration usage with examples

## Code Quality and Testing
