# WireDI Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the WireDI project. Each task is logically ordered and covers both architectural and code-level improvements.

## Architecture Improvements

[ ] Refactor WireRepository class to reduce its size and complexity
   - Split into smaller, more focused classes following Single Responsibility Principle
   - Extract factory methods into a separate factory class
   - Consider using the Builder pattern for configuration

[x] Implement a plugin architecture for extending the framework
   - Create a standardized plugin interface
   - Add plugin discovery mechanism
   - Document plugin development process

[x] Improve error handling and reporting
   - Create a consistent error handling strategy
   - Enhance error messages with more context
   - Add support for custom error handlers

[ ] Enhance configuration management
   - Implement hierarchical configuration
   - Add validation for configuration properties

[ ] Optimize performance
   - Profile the application to identify bottlenecks
   - Reduce memory footprint
   - Optimize startup time

## Code Quality Improvements

[ ] Increase test coverage
   - Add unit tests for all public methods
   - Add integration tests for common use cases
   - Implement property-based testing for edge cases

[ ] Improve code documentation
   - Add JavaDoc to all public classes and methods
   - Create code examples for common use cases
   - Document design decisions and trade-offs

[ ] Refactor code for better maintainability
   - Apply consistent naming conventions
   - Remove code duplication
   - Simplify complex methods

[ ] Enhance logging
   - Add structured logging
   - Implement log levels consistently
   - Add context information to log messages

[ ] Address technical debt
   - Fix TODO comments in the codebase
   - Update deprecated API usages
   - Resolve compiler warnings

## Feature Improvements

[ ] Implement "ConditionalOnClass" feature
   - An IdentifiableProvider should only be loaded, if this condition applies
   - This should be easily extendable and not hard coded
   - Maybe with a "StaticLoadCondition", that's loaded in parallel to the IdentifiableProvider

[ ] Improve PropertyBinding (from TODO.md)
   - Support nested classes
   - Automatically resolve correct property path
   - Add validation for property bindings

[ ] Implement scopes for WireRepository (from TODO.md)
   - Add support for different bean scopes (singleton, prototype, request, etc.)
   - Make scopes extensible
   - Document scope usage

[ ] Make the Aspect part a plugin (from TODO.md)
   - Extract aspect functionality into a plugin
   - Support custom aspect implementations
   - Document aspect development

[ ] Add injection support for PropertyReference parameters (from TODO.md)
   - Implement property reference injection
   - Add validation for property references
   - Document property reference usage

[ ] Implement "Strict" mode (from TODO.md)
   - Add compile-time validation
   - Reduce runtime customization options
   - Optimize performance in strict mode

## Integration Improvements

[ ] Enhance Jackson integration
   - Add support for custom serializers/deserializers
   - Improve performance of serialization/deserialization
   - Document Jackson integration usage

[ ] Improve security integration
   - Add support for role-based access control
   - Implement security annotations
   - Document security integration usage

[ ] Enhance cache integration
   - Support different cache providers
   - Add cache statistics
   - Document cache integration usage

[ ] Improve messaging integration
   - Support different messaging protocols
   - Add message validation
   - Document messaging integration usage

[ ] Enhance metrics integration
   - Add support for different metrics providers
   - Implement automatic metrics collection
   - Document metrics integration usage

## Documentation Improvements

[ ] Create comprehensive user guide
   - Add getting started guide
   - Document all features
   - Include troubleshooting section

[ ] Improve API documentation
   - Document all public APIs
   - Add code examples
   - Document design patterns used

[ ] Create architecture documentation
   - Document high-level architecture
   - Explain design decisions
   - Include component diagrams

[ ] Add migration guides
   - Document breaking changes between versions
   - Provide migration steps
   - Include code examples for migration

[ ] Enhance example projects
   - Create more comprehensive examples
   - Document examples
   - Include best practices
