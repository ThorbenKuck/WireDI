/**
 * A EnvironmentExpressionResolver is a class that allows for custom property placeholder prefixes.
 * <p>
 * For example, To implement support for the prefix /, which would look like this: "/{...}", you'd need to provide
 * a custom EnvironmentExpressionResolver, which handles the identifier "/".
 * <p>
 * Please note: This class should be stateless. It is loaded once globally and hence any state will stay for multiple
 * executions of different WireRepositories.
